# Lessons Learned

## 2026-03-21 — Procurement Module Build

### Issue 1: Missing Edit/Delete Actions
**What happened:** Built entire procurement module with only List, Add, and View pages. No Edit or Delete buttons anywhere.
**Root cause:** Focused on models/views/templates for the "happy path" and forgot CRUD completeness.
**Rule:** Every new module MUST include all 5 CRUD operations (list, create, detail, edit, delete) from the start. Added to CLAUDE.md under "CRUD Completeness Rules".

### Issue 2: Seed Command Crashed on Second Run
**What happened:** `python manage.py seed_procurement` worked first time but crashed with `IntegrityError: Duplicate entry` on second run because requisition numbers (PR-00001) have unique_together constraint.
**Root cause:** Used bare `.save()` instead of `get_or_create` or existence checks for models with unique constraints.
**Rule:** All seed commands must be idempotent — check for existing records before creating. Added to CLAUDE.md under "Seed Command Rules".

### Issue 3: Data Not Showing After Seed
**What happened:** User ran seed_procurement successfully but saw empty pages. Was logged in as superuser `admin` which has `tenant=None`.
**Root cause:** Didn't warn user about tenant isolation. All views filter by `request.tenant` which is `None` for superuser.
**Rule:** Always print tenant admin login credentials after seeding and warn that superuser won't see tenant-scoped data. Added to CLAUDE.md under "Multi-Tenancy Rules".

### Issue 4: Missing `__init__.py` in management/commands
**What happened:** Forgot to create `__init__.py` files when creating `management/commands/` directory structure.
**Root cause:** Created directory with `mkdir` but forgot Django requires `__init__.py` for package discovery.
**Rule:** Always create both `management/__init__.py` and `management/commands/__init__.py`. Added to CLAUDE.md under "Seed Command Rules".

### Issue 5: Used `&&` in Shell Commands — PowerShell ParserError
**What happened:** When user asked for all git commits in one copy, output used `&&` to chain `git add` + `git commit`. User ran them and got `The token '&&' is not a valid statement separator in this version` because they're on Windows PowerShell 5.x.
**Root cause:** Defaulted to bash/POSIX syntax without considering the user runs commands in PowerShell on Windows. PowerShell 5 requires `;` as statement separator; `&&` only works in PowerShell 7+.
**Rule:** ALWAYS use `;` (not `&&`) when chaining commands for the user to run. Applies to git bulk-commit lists and any other shell snippets. If stop-on-failure is required, put commands on separate lines instead of chaining. Added to CLAUDE.md under "GIT Commit Rule → Shell Compatibility".

### Issue 6: `unique_together(tenant, X)` bypassed at form layer when `tenant` is not a form field
**What happened:** While writing a test for "duplicate SKU in same tenant should be rejected", the view raised a 500 `IntegrityError` instead of a form error. Django's `ModelForm.validate_unique()` calls `_get_validation_exclusions()` which excludes any model field that isn't rendered on the form — so `tenant` was excluded, the partial unique check `(sku,)` found no clash, and the duplicate reached the DB.
**Root cause:** The module pattern of "set `instance.tenant = self.tenant` only inside `save()`" means the form's `_post_clean()` runs with `instance.tenant_id = None`, and Django skips unique_together constraints that involve excluded fields.
**Rule:** For every `ModelForm` backed by a model with `unique_together = ('tenant', <field>)`, either (a) add an explicit `clean_<field>()` that filters by `self.tenant` and raises a `ValidationError` on duplicate, or (b) override `_get_validation_exclusions()` to drop `'tenant'` from the exclusion set. Option (a) is simpler and preserves Django's default exclusion behavior. See `catalog/forms.py:ProductForm.clean_sku` as the reference implementation.
**Scope:** Audit every other module (`administration`, `purchase_orders`, `receiving`, `warehousing`, `inventory`, `stock_movements`, `lot_tracking`, `orders`, `returns`, `stocktaking`, `multi_location`, `forecasting`) for the same bug — any `ModelForm` saving a model with `unique_together` that includes `tenant` is potentially affected.
